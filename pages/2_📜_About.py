    '''This is not meant to be an inspirational page, nor is it meant to sound like
    a revolutionary Steve Jobs product reveal. The bottomline is this: applying for internships
    is already a tideous process as is. Now imagine having to write a bunch of essays, add to
    that customized cover letters for each role you are applying for? 
    (Might as well stick to that campus job you have been avoiding). The shere burden and pressures
    that come with such a repetitive process can, thanks to AI, be automated, streamlining the transition
    from learning about the internship to clicking that coveted submit button. Turbo Intern allows
    you to do exactly that, leaving you with more time to focus on  more productive tasks like
    focusing on your assignments, projects, and procrastinating 😏.

    ### What can I get out of this? 🏆

    Short answer? Basically anything related to the internship application process concerning essay
    writing, resume adjustment, and cover letter editing. Instead of writing generic essays and
    text that might not relate to, or align with your experiences, personality and the nature of the
    role you are applying for, Turbo Intern creates a dedicated profile for you based on 
    the following contexts to tailor-make responses which are relevant to you and the role 
    you are applying for:

    1. Job Description (Retreived from URL link) 👔
    2. Resume 🎖️
    3. Cover Letter 📑
    4. Writing Style Samples ✏️
    5. Personal Information 🪞

    Turbo intern helps you write essays from application prompts staying close to, but within the
    word-count limit. Ever been given an essay prompt similar to one you wrote before but don't
    know exactly how to readjust it to meet the needs of the current essay? Turbo Intern helps with exactly
    that, following flexible customizations relevant to the job description while adhering to your specified
    writing style.

    '''
    Though most internships list these as optional, a good cover letter will most likely do more good than
    not having one. The main drawback is the fact that good cover letters are very company and role-specific,
    so having to re-write drafts everytime can be highly inconvenient. Turbo Intern reduces the conception
    to draft period, allowing for instant draft generation in your own voice, and with your own experiences
    as context.

    On top of writing drafts, Turbo Intern also helps with resume and cover letter improvement 
    using the CAR (Context, Action, Result) and STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) frameworks. If
    there are any misalignments that exist and given enough information, the draft improved, aligned with
    CAR or STAR is provided automatically for your guidance.
